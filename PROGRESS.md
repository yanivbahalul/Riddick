# Progress Log

Tracking each training run: config, results, and what we learned. Goal is
incremental improvement, not jumping straight to a complex architecture.

## Baseline model

`LowLightEnhanceNet` in `train.py` — 3 Conv2d layers (32 hidden channels),
ReLU between, Sigmoid output. No skip connections, no normalization. This is
intentionally the simplest possible baseline.

## Runs

### Run 1 — pipeline smoke test
- Config: `--epochs 3 --batch-size 8 --image-size 64`
- Loss: 0.1757 -> 0.1703 -> 0.1631
- Purpose: verify train.py runs end to end on real data. No real learning expected.

### Run 2 — MPS smoke test
- Config: `--epochs 2 --batch-size 8 --image-size 64`
- Confirmed `torch.backends.mps.is_available() == True` on M4, training ran
  successfully through MPS instead of CPU.
- Loss: 0.1745 -> 0.1691

### Run 3 — first full run (complete)
- Config: `--epochs 50 --batch-size 8 --image-size 256 --lr 1e-4` (all defaults)
- Loss: 0.1290 (epoch 37) -> 0.1263 (epoch 50) — flattened out in the last
  13 epochs, confirms the plateau observation below.
- Evaluation on `eval15` (`model_epoch50.pth`): PSNR=17.82, SSIM=0.7322
  (avg over 15 images). Big jump from the epoch-1 smoke-test checkpoint
  (PSNR~12.75, SSIM~0.45), so the model is genuinely learning, not just
  memorizing — but numbers still modest for this task (strong results in
  papers are usually PSNR 20+, SSIM 0.8+).
- Observation: loss decreased slowly relative to epoch count, and flattened
  near the end. Likely ceiling of the simple 3-layer architecture, not a bug.

## Planned next steps (in order, not jumping ahead)

1. ~~Finish Run 3, evaluate with `evaluate.py`, record PSNR/SSIM below.~~ Done.
2. Try a longer run or tuned learning rate on the same architecture before
   changing anything structural — isolate whether the ceiling is the
   architecture or just needs more training.
3. Only after that: consider architectural changes (U-Net skip connections,
   Zero-DCE's zero-reference approach) and compare metrics against this
   baseline.

## Evaluation results

| Checkpoint | PSNR | SSIM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Run 3, epoch 50 | 17.82 | 0.7322 | baseline 3-layer CNN, 50 epochs, 256x256 |
